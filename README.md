# Scripts to ease my life
Generally, these are the scripts I wrote and use everyday to make my life a little less painful

#### Spotify Opener
A bash script that does the following:
  * Opens spotify if it is not opened already then starts playing music
  * If spotify is open it acts as atraditional Play/Pause button

I used the script to bind it to my Audio Play/Pause button.
