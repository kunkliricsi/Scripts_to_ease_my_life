# Scripts to ease my life
Generally, these are the scripts I wrote and use everyday to make my life a little less painful

#### Spotify Opener
A bash script that opens Spotify if it's not opened already and acts as a traditional Play/Pause button if it's open.
I bound the script to the Audio Play/Pause button.
